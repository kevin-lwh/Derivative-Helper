# Derivative-Helper
The Derivative Helper will derive any polynomials the user inputs and even graph it to give a visual aid. The user will input a function, such as y=3x^3+2x^2-x+6, in a GUI that will contain intuitive buttons to derive or graph it.

## Requirements
* NetBeans or any Java IDE

## Instructions
Simply open the "Derivative-Helper" project in NetBeans or other Java IDE and hit run.

## Features
1. Finding the Derivative
   - Derives the function by finding the new coefficients, exponents and remove the constant for the first derivative base on the userâ€™s input and displays it in a new window.
2. Finding the Derivative at a point (tangent line)
   - Set up a loop to calculate the y-value at given x-value.
   - Using the derivative function calculate the slope of the tangent line at x-point.
   - Output a standard equation of the tangent line at the input x-value.
3. Graphing
   - The user will have the option of graphing both the original function and the derivative.
   - Loops through values of x to find y and plot points on graph.
   
## User Manual
1. Inputting the function
   - When the user runs the program, they will be greeted with this window. It is a very simple window with the first text field allowing the user to input the function following the format of from the highest exponents to the lowest exponents. Eg. y=5x^2+x-10 with no caps or spaces in between. The current program only handles with polynomials with negative exponents. After inputting the function into the text field, the user must click save to save the function in order for further calculations.
